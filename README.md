**What is a bastion host?**
A bastion host is a server used to manage access to an internal or private network from an external network - sometimes called a jump box or jump server. Because bastion hosts often sit on the Internet, they typically run a minimum amount of services in order to reduce their attack surface. They are also commonly used to proxy and log communications, such as SSH sessions.
